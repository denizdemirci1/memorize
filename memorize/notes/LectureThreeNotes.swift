 STRUCTS:                                                             Classes:
 Value type.                                                |       Reference type
 Copied when passed or assigned.            |       Passed around via pointers.
 Copies on write so it's performant.           |       Automatically reference counted (when there is no reference, resources gets released. Garbage Collection kind of mechanism.
 Functional programming.                        |       Object-orianted programming
 No inheritance, protocols                          |      Single inheritance
 Free init, initializes all Vars                        |      Free init, initializes no Vars
 Mutability must be explicitly stated           |       Always mutable
 
 Structs are more widely used with SwiftUI. Classes are usually used when we want the thing to be shared, such as ViewModel.
